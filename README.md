# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React App Setup with Vite

A beginner-friendly guide for creating and running a React application using Vite, the modern build tool that replaces Create React App (CRA).

This guide walks you through setting up your first React app using Vite, a fast, modern build tool designed for an optimized developer experience.

## Prerequisites

You’ll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

Check if Node is Installed: `node -v`

If installed, this returns a version like v23.1.0.

## Required Versions

Vite requires:

- Node v18+ or v20+

### Update npm

Even if you just installed Node, it’s a good idea to update npm:
`# macOS / Linux`
`sudo npm install -g npm@latest`

## Setting Up Your React App with Vite

Vite helps you quickly generate a boilerplate React app with an optimized configuration.

### Benefits of Using Vite

1. Consistent, familiar project structure

2. Optimized builds out-of-the-box

3. Lightning-fast dev server with hot module replacement (HMR)

4. Modern tooling with minimal setup
